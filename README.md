		  `Add-Migration <any name for the script Eg: Initial-17-07-2023>` 
	
	III. To create the database from migration script run (make sure letter-of-no-evidence.api is the start-up project and override the DB connection string in letter-of-no-evidence.api -> Program.cs file with your local)
		  `update-database`
